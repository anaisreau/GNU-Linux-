<h1 id="gnu-linux-os-">GNU Linux OS !</h1>
<h2 id="introduction.">Introduction.</h2>
<p>Every modern computer whether it is a desktop computer, a laptot, a smartphone or a tablette, needs an operating system.</p>
<p>An operating system helps a computer to store files, to manage memory, to switch between different applications, to keep itself secure and interact with printers, scanners or cameras.</p>
<p>Different operating systems have different approaches, frequently they run on different types of hardware and are designed for different types of applications, that is why you can not run a Window program on a Mac computer.</p>
<p>Nowdays among the most popular operating system we can list:</p>
<p>• Windows<br>
• Mac OS<br>
• Apple iOS<br>
• Google’s Android OS<br>
• Linux</p>
<p>The majority of operating systems are freely available. The best example is Linux.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>At the very beginning it was Richard Stallman who launched in 1983 a project to develop an “GNU” OS based on the UNIX server, but faced with the low availability of this server, Linus Torvald (Finnish) in 1991 created the core of this OS and gives it the linux kernel name, then it deposits it under GNU GPL license to make them legally compatible + easily used by all</p>
<p>GNU / Linux will have the most impact in the server world where it will be widely used, and then will become more widely available because:</p>
<p>better than other UNIX systems</p>
<p>avoids the purchase of windows licenses,</p>
<p>allows development on OS on mobile device, for example smartphones</p>
<p>The Linux kernel equips most embedded systems, civil or military (box, robots, aerospace, drones …).</p>
<p>Today it represents in market share:</p>
<ul>
<li>91% in 2011 of supercomputers</li>
<li>72% growth in mobile phones in 2010</li>
<li>16.8% in 2008 of servers</li>
<li>32.6% Linux in 2012 web servers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="projects-philosophy">Project’s Philosophy</h2>
<p>GNU / Linux was born from the encounter of the hacker’s operating mode (that is to say, to find quick solutions to solve a problem) with a free software. For Linux the hacker and the free software are two different facets of the same object.2-1 What is a free software;A free software is not necessary open source. Open source is a development philosophy that is more business oriented, free software is a social and moral philosophy. Free software means users have the four essential freedoms :</p>
<ol>
<li>to run the program,</li>
<li>to study and change the program in source code form,</li>
<li>to redistribute exact copies,</li>
<li>to distribute modified versions.</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, a free software allows user control of the program and the possibility of sharing between individuals, and that is what makes the philosophy of the GNU / Linux group.</p>
<h2 id="linux-distribution">Linux Distribution</h2>
<p>A linux distribution is anOS made from a software collection that is based upon the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Linux users canobtain their OS by downloading one of them which are available for a variety of system ranging from embedded devices, personal computers to powerful supercomputers.</p>
<p>​They are many linux distribution like :</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian</li>
<li>Ubuntu</li>
<li>Linux Mint</li>
<li>Red hat enterprise Linux</li>
<li>Kali   ​</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Debian:</strong></p>
<p>Was established by Ian Murdock in August 1993.</p>
<p>The first version was released in September 1993 and the first stable version in June 1996.</p>
<p>Most popular edition for personal computers and servers and is the basis for many other distributions.<br>
​<br>
<strong>Ubuntu:</strong></p>
<p>Based on Debian, Ubuntu is a popular OS for cloud computing.</p>
<p>Was released in three editions : Desktop, Server and Core for the internet of things and robots.</p>
<p>Released every 6 months with long-term support every 2 years.</p>
<p>Ubuntu is named after the African Nguni philosophy of ubuntu which Canonical translate as “humanity to others” or “I am what I am because of who we all are”.<br>
​<br>
<strong>Kali Linux:</strong></p>
<p>Was released in march 2013 to suceed BackTrack Linux</p>
<p>Designed for digital forensics and penetration testing.</p>
<p>Maintenedand funded by Offensive Security Ltd</p>
